   src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\Kognit USB Writer_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe

   The standalone executable (without installer) will be at:
   src-tauri\target\release\kognit-usb-writer.exe

The NSIS installer:
- Single .exe file

- One-click install (no wizard)
- Includes application icon
- Installs to user's AppData (no admin required by default)
- Can request elevation if needed


COPY TO RELEASES
================
After building, copy to the releases folder:

copy "src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\Kognit USB Writer_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe" releases\windows\

Then commit and push:
git add releases\windows\
git commit -m "Add Windows installer"
git push origin main


CODE SIGNING (Optional)
=======================
For trusted distribution without Windows SmartScreen warnings:

1. Purchase a code signing certificate from:
   - DigiCert, Sectigo, GlobalSign, etc.
   - EV (Extended Validation) certificates have immediate trust
   - Standard OV certificates build trust over time

2. Sign the executable:
   signtool sign /f certificate.pfx /p password /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 "Kognit USB Writer_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe"

Without signing, users will see SmartScreen warning on first run.
They can click "More info" > "Run anyway" to proceed.
